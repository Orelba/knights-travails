# Knights Travails

An implementation of a BFS algorithm to solve the 'Knights Travails' problem,
finding the shortest path for a chess knight to move from point A to point B on a standard 8x8 chessboard.

## To run the script:
Run `script.js`.

There are already a few demonstration of usage there,
you can use your own coordinates to get different paths.

## Usage:
* `KnightMoves(source, destination)` - the following function will receive the coordinates of the source and destination squares in the form of two arrays of [x, y].  
the function return the number of moves needed to complete the path and the coordinates of each square in the path.
